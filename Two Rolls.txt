Two Rolls
User is playing a board game, and is currently at position X.
To win, he needs to reach position 50.

User has a pair of 6-sided dice, which will decide how he moves -
he will roll the pair of dice, sum up the numbers on them, and then move exactly that many steps forward.

More precisely, if the dice show values of d1 and d2, User must move from X to (X+d1+d2).

However, Chef's dice are a bit weird: rather than starting from 1, they start from Y.

That is, the values on a single die are Y,Y+1,Y+2,Y+3,Y+4,Y+5.

Is it possible for Chef to win the game by reaching position 50, after exactly one turn?
Note that Chef must exactly land on position 50 after his move - going beyond it does not count as a win.
